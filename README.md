# hello world again

I'm glad to welcome you to my repository on Github. In this repository, you will find many interesting and useful things written in Python.

For example, here is a small code snippet that demonstrates how to calculate the sum of numbers in a list:

python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum = 0
for num in numbers:
    sum += num
print("Sum of numbers in the list:", sum)

And here is another code snippet that demonstrates how to sort a list of strings in alphabetical order:
python
words = ["banana", "apple", "cherry", "date"]
words.sort()
print("List of strings in alphabetical order:", words)
I hope you will enjoy my projects on Github. Please feel free to leave comments and feedback, they are very important to me!
